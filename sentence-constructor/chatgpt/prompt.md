Vokabelliste
Deutsch	Englisch
Pferd	Pferd
laufen	biegać
Feld	pole
Satzstruktur
Subjekt + Verb + Ort

Hinweise und Überlegungen
Das Subjekt steht im Plural, also muss das Verb entsprechend konjugiert werden.
Das Verb bedeutet „biegać“, aber es gibt eine spezifische deutsche Entsprechung für Tiere.
„Po polu“ erfordert eine passende Präposition mit Dativ.
